# Introduction

The objective of this repository is to log lessons I have learned while working with supercomputers and remote servers. It does not content many code _per se_, it rather contains a gentle introduction to the subject and provides basic instructions and commands to remind me how it is done.

This repository is mainly addressed to people new to supercomputing and server administration, with little to no experience, or formal education in the subject, such as me. Please feel free to explore the subdirectories of this repository, I hope it can help you.
